### These are the few of the things can be added further. 
- Since the default styling for each HTML element is different, we can define a list of such default styles to compare against for more HTML tags.
- Create an object of attributes including src, aria-label, placeholder, label etc for each tag type that must be checked against and assigned to the element in the new DOM Tree. 
- Simulate the behavior of hover, focus and click events to get the style for these specific selectors and add them to the list of classes.
